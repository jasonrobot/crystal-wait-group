{"repository_name":"github.com/jasonrobot/crystal-wait-group","body":"# crystal-wait-group\n\nThis is a Crystal implementation of golang's sync.WaitGroup\n\nThere's probably still some work that needs to be done here, but it seems to work pretty well!\n\n## Installation\n\n1. Add the dependency to your `shard.yml`:\n\n   ```yaml\n   dependencies:\n     crystal-wait-group:\n       github: jasonrobot/crystal-wait-group\n   ```\n\n2. Run `shards install`\n\n## Usage\n\n```crystal\nrequire \"crystal-wait-group\"\n```\n\nTo use like Go's WaitGroup, there are the `add`, `done`, and `wait` methods. They should work just as expected.\n\n```\nwg = WaitGroup.new\nwg.add\nspawn do\n  sleep 1\n  wg.done\nend\nwg.wait\n```\n\nAs a fun crystal-style addition, there is also a `spawn` method which takes a block and spawns it in a fiber that is waited for by the WaitGroup.\n\n```\nwg = WaitGroup.new\nwg.spawn do\n  sleep 1\nend\nwg.wait\n```\n\n## Development\n\nAll feedback is welcome! This is my first time playing with concurrency at this level, or doing low-level Crystal stuff, so there's gotta be room for improvment. The usage of `Intrinsics.pause` is taken from `Crystal::SpinLock`. Basically what I've gone for here is a version of SpinLock built around an atomic counter.\n\n## Contributing\n\n1. Fork it (<https://github.com/jasonrobot/crystal-wait-group/fork>)\n2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`)\n3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some feature'`)\n4. Push to the branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`)\n5.
